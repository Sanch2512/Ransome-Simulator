🔐 SECURITY POLICY
Welcome to the Security & Responsible Use Guide for the Ransomware Simulator Project.

This project was created strictly for educational, ethical hacking, and research purposes. It is meant to raise awareness about ransomware attacks and help security professionals understand their behavior in a safe, isolated environment (preferably on a virtual machine or sandbox).

🚨 ⚠️ Usage Disclaimer
This simulator does NOT contain malicious code targeting real user data. However, misuse of the project outside its intended purpose can be harmful and is strictly discouraged.

🔴 Do not run this on a host machine with personal or sensitive data.

🧪 Always use within a virtual machine (VM) or cybersecurity lab setup.

📁 It encrypts a test file generated by the program itself — no real files are targeted.

📝 A simulated ransom note is created only for awareness, with no real payment mechanics involved.

🛡️ Security Measures in the Code
This simulator uses secure methods and intentionally limits functionality to prevent real-world misuse:

✅ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption

✅ Controlled test environment — no recursive file targeting

✅ Clear separation between payload and key

✅ No persistence, no auto-replication

✅ Educational warnings and comments inside the code

🔒 Recommendations for Safe Testing
To ensure maximum security while running the simulation:

🔐 Use a virtual machine with no access to host system files.

📵 Disable internet access during execution.

🧪 Review the source code before running.

🧹 Clean test artifacts after use.

🧑‍💻 Ethical Conduct
Please remember:

With great power comes great responsibility.

This project must never be used for malicious purposes.

If you're studying malware behavior, always work under legal and ethical frameworks.

Be a responsible ethical hacker or researcher. Promote security, not harm.
